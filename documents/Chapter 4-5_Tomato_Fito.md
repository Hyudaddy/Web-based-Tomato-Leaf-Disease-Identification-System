# Chapter IV

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The development of a web-based tomato leaf disease identification system for tomato farmers serves as a vital step toward modernizing agricultural practices and improving crop health management. Through **Fito – Tomato Leaf Disease Identification System**, users can upload images of tomato leaves and receive automated diagnoses powered by machine learning. This enables early and relatively accurate identification of common tomato leaf diseases without requiring expert presence in the field.

By reducing reliance on purely manual visual inspection, which can be error-prone and time-consuming, the system helps farmers obtain timely feedback, even in remote locations. The platform delivers instant predictions, confidence scores, and disease information, guiding users on possible causes, symptoms, and suggested management strategies.

Furthermore, integrating detailed disease information—such as disease symptoms, visual indicators, progression patterns, and recommended control measures—adds significant value. It empowers farmers and agricultural technicians with actionable insights, encouraging timely interventions and more sustainable management practices. The combination of automatic detection and educational support enhances decision-making, potentially reducing crop loss and improving overall yield quality. However, the long-term success and adoption of the system still depend on continuous model improvement, user training, and access to suitable devices and connectivity.

## Results and Discussions of the Model Accuracy

The performance of the tomato leaf disease classification model was evaluated using standard metrics: **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**. The trained model classifies images into **10 tomato disease classes plus healthy leaves**, resulting in a total of 11 categories. The system is powered by a convolutional neural network trained on thousands of tomato leaf images, including augmented samples to increase robustness.

The current version of Fito achieves an overall accuracy of approximately **85%** across the supported disease classes, as reflected in the deployed system. This level of accuracy is considered acceptable for practical decision support when used together with farmer expertise.

> Fill in the exact number of test images and metric values based on your evaluation.

To analyze model performance, a **confusion matrix** can be constructed for each class and/or for the overall classifier. This matrix summarizes true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN):

- **True Positive (TP):** The model predicts a disease, and the leaf is indeed affected by that disease.
- **True Negative (TN):** The model predicts another class, and the leaf truly belongs to that other class.
- **False Positive (FP):** The model predicts a disease, but the leaf actually belongs to another disease or is healthy.
- **False Negative (FN):** The model fails to detect a disease that is actually present.

You may include separate confusion matrix figures (e.g., **Figure 21–28**) for each major disease class and one for healthy leaves. Each figure should briefly describe how well the model identifies that class and note any patterns of misclassification.

**Figure 29. Accuracy Chart** can summarize per-class accuracy or F1-score. Classes with distinct visual patterns tend to exhibit higher performance, while those with overlapping symptoms may have relatively lower metrics, guiding future data collection and model refinement.

This study, entitled **“Fito: Tomato Leaf Disease Identification System using Machine Learning”**, aimed to develop a system that can automatically identify tomato leaf diseases from images. By enabling users to upload tomato leaf images through a web-based interface, the system addresses the need for practical, accessible tools that help farmers and agricultural practitioners detect diseases early and reduce potential yield loss.

The system was designed to be:

- Accessible through a modern, responsive web interface;
- Simple and intuitive for non-technical users;
- Accurate enough to provide meaningful decision support (approximately **85%** accuracy across 10 tomato diseases plus healthy leaves).

To evaluate software quality, the ISO/IEC 25010 framework was used, covering Effectiveness, Efficiency, Usability, Reliability, Security, Compatibility, Functional Suitability, and Maintainability. In addition, the classification model’s performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that the system has strong potential to support tomato disease monitoring and management in real-world settings.

### Conclusions

Based on the findings of this study and the current implementation of Fito, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Practical Tool for Early Detection**  
   The tomato leaf disease identification system provides a practical means of performing early detection of tomato leaf diseases using digital images. This supports better crop management and can reduce the time required to identify diseases compared with manual inspection alone.

2. **Acceptable Software Quality (ISO/IEC 25010)**  
   Evaluation using the ISO/IEC 25010 model indicates that the system achieves an overall mean of **[insert overall ISO/IEC mean]** with a descriptive rating of **[e.g., Highly Acceptable]** across the quality characteristics. Users generally perceive the system as functionally suitable, efficient, usable, reliable, secure, maintainable, and sufficiently compatible with their devices.

3. **Model Performance and Accuracy**  
   The deployed model achieves an approximate overall accuracy of **85%** across tomato diseases and healthy leaves. While not perfect, this performance level is adequate for serving as a decision-support tool when combined with farmer expertise or guidance from agricultural professionals.

4. **User-Centered Design**  
   The interface and workflow are designed with farmers and non-technical users in mind. The ability to upload images, receive instant predictions, and view clear explanations contributes to positive perceptions of usability and usefulness.

5. **Potential for Further Enhancement**  
   Although the system already shows promising results, there are still opportunities to improve compatibility, robustness under real field conditions (e.g., varying lighting and camera quality), and integration with other agricultural information systems.

### Recommendations

In light of the findings and conclusions, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Expand and Diversify the Dataset**  
   Future development should focus on gathering more tomato leaf images from diverse environments, varieties, and stages of disease progression. Including real field images with different lighting and camera qualities can help the model generalize better and improve classification performance.

2. **Continuous Model Improvement**  
   The model should be periodically retrained using updated datasets and improved architectures. Techniques such as advanced augmentation, fine-tuning difficult classes, and threshold optimization can be used to reduce misclassification rates.

3. **User Training and Documentation**  
   Training sessions, user manuals, and online guides are recommended to help farmers and agricultural technicians understand how to capture good-quality images and interpret system outputs. Clear documentation also supports system maintainers and future developers.

4. **Strengthen Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   Efforts should be made to optimize the system for various devices (smartphones, tablets, low-spec computers) and browsers. This may involve additional testing on common platforms and UI adjustments to ensure consistent behavior and usability.

5. **Enhance Security and Data Governance**  
   As more user data and images may be collected over time, it is essential to maintain strong security practices, including secure communication, proper access control, and clear privacy policies.

6. **Integration with Extension Services and Institutions**  
   The system can be integrated into agricultural extension programs, cooperatives, and academic institutions offering agriculture-related courses. Students and researchers can use Fito as a platform for experiments, further improvements, and applied research in smart farming.

7. **Future Research Directions**  
   Future work may explore extending the system to other crops or additional tomato diseases, incorporating severity estimation (mild, moderate, severe), providing localized treatment recommendations based on region-specific guidelines, and developing an offline-first or dedicated mobile application tailored to rural environments.

Overall, **Fito: Tomato Leaf Disease Identification System** demonstrates strong potential as a practical decision-support tool for tomato disease management. With continued development, broader deployment, and institutional collaboration, the system can become an effective component of modern, technology-assisted agriculture.
